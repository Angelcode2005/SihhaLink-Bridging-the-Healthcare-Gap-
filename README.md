SihhaLink: Democratizing Healthcare

🌟 Project Mission
"Technology is a universal right." SihhaLink bridges the digital divide in Morocco by providing a secure, human-centric healthcare portal.

🤝 Collaborative Logic & Individual Contribution

*Design Background: The system architecture was developed collaboratively on a Shared Miro Board as a foundational blueprint for the project.

*My Core Responsibility: I served as the Lead UI/UX Architect and Frontend Developer for the Patient Interface and the Laboratory Portal, translating our joint conceptual designs into this functional codebase.

*Implementation: I independently developed the code in this repository to translate our wireframes into a functional, responsive healthcare system.

🛠 System Architecture (Current & Roadmap)

*The Gateway (Live): Secure authentication and a 5-step onboarding flow (Account Creation, Personal Data, Role Selection, CINE Verification, and Guided Video).

*Patient Interface (Upcoming): A comprehensive dashboard for medical record management and real-time appointment tracking, directly based on our Miro designs.

*Identity & Trust: A specialized module for identity verification to ensure a safe environment for all stakeholders.
